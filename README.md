## Summary
The analysis of the Citi Bike data showed that biker data is largely based on male bikers with shorter sessions. In addition, the most active time of day is between 5-6pm. Lastly, the recurring (i.e., subscriber) customers make up most the customer types and are commonly used by female bikers. Through these visualizations, it is evident which strategies should be used to manage to Des Moines customer base.
